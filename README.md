# About the project:
The aim of this project was to investigate whether experiential learning would have an impact on the effectiveness of learning Fitts' Law. We hypothesise that people will learn Fitts' Law better when they can interact with buttons of different distances and sizes. We will use an online website as the platform for this experiment, as it is the most common and context-free way of learning online and facilitates the evaluation of the effectiveness of participants' engagement in experiential learning.<br><br>
In this study, participants will first complete a pre-test questionnaire. This will be followed by an initial introduction to Fitts Law on the website. Users will debug the button distance and size of the interface in the Tutorial interface, and after the interface countdown, will participate in different versions of the game, which will involve seeing and feeling the changes in Movement Time (MT) for the interface buttons they have set, and completing a shortcut question test. Participants will be randomly assigned equally to different groups. Participants assigned to Group A will only be able to see changes in MT, while participants in Group B will be able to see and click to feel changes in MT. The purpose of this design is to ensure that a control group can be presented to compare the different learning styles in order to better identify the effectiveness of the participants' learning. The study lasts 15 minutes and at the end, participants are redirected to a post-test questionnaire page and are asked to complete a post-test evaluation of their user experience and the usability of the tool.<br><br>
In our user study, we will use the questionnaire to collect data in two separate sessions: (a) before participants use the Shortcuts Easy Learn (SEL) online learning tool for the Fitts Law learning activity (pretest), and (b) after students have completed the SEL learning tool-mediated learning activity (posttest).<br><br>
The pretest questionnaire consists of two parts: (a) demographic questions recording students' age (open-ended questions) and gender (female, male); and (b) a knowledge test. The post-test questionnaire consisted of five sections: (a) knowledge test, (b) perceived educational experience scale, (c) system usability scale (SUS), (d) usability adjective scores, and (e) open-ended questions about the positive and negative features of the SEL online learning tool, suggestions for improvement and any other comments. These research questionnaires were created using the Google Forms service, and we will provide the URLs to participants before and after use. <br><br>
Research Question<br>
How does experiencing (observing vs. observing and clicking) various configurations of button distances and sizes impact on learning Fitts' Law in multiple-choice interface design?”<br>
### Research Design
Methods: within-subjects<br>
We have followed the within-subjects experimental design of this study. Participants will be divided into 2 groups, and all group members will participate in a pre-study knowledge test as well as experiential learning with Fitt's Law. In order to reduce the confounding variables of the test, group A will act as a control group.<br>
Number of participants: 10 university students<br>
A minimum of 10 university students will be recruited to participate in this experiment.<br>
Duration: approximately 25 minutes (including learning test and questionnaire)<br>
Before the experiment begins, participants will fill out a knowledge test, which may take about 5 minutes. The website content study and learning test will take about 15min and at the end of the experiment participants will be asked to fill in questions, which may take about 10 minutes. The total time cost is approximately 25 min.<br>
### Procedures.<br>
1.	Learning and testing rules are explained to participants.<br>
2.	Participants read the participant information sheet and sign the Consent Form.<br>
3.	Participants are randomly and equally divided into two groups (Group A, Group B).<br>
4.	Visit http://3.87.225.135/ in a laptop or Android device using a browser.<br>
5.	Participants will first complete a pretest questionnaire on google form.<br>

6.	Participants will then read materials about Fitts’ Law on the website and be asked to adjust the distance and size of the buttons in the tutorial page.<br>
7.	At the end of the countdown, group A will perform Test 1 (observation only) and group B will perform Test 2.<br>
8.	Participants in group B are asked to continue completing the test as quickly and accurately as possible and to check their results.<br>
9.	Participants start Test 1 or 2.<br>
10.	Participants will be asked to complete a post-test questionnaire after the experiment.<br>
11.	Participants will complete the posttest questionnaire on google form.<br>
